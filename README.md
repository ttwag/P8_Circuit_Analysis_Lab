# Circuit Analysis

I did these 7 labs with a lab partner when I took [EEC100](https://ece.ucdavis.edu/course-catalog) at UC Davis. We used the lab instruments at UC Davis Kemper Hall.

These labs involve hand-calculating the circuits' output waveform then verifying them using OrCAD simulation and real-world experiments. 

My personal favorite is Lab 5, where the circuit's input is a periodic sawtooth wave. Since a sawtooth wave is not sinusoidal, we used the Fourier Series, the transfer function of the circuit, and phasor analysis to model the output waveform. It was amazing that the experiment gave us a similar result to our model obtained from the Fourier Analysis Theory.
